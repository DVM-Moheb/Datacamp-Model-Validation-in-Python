    "1. Creating train, test, and validation datasets\n",
    "> Hello everyone - Let's get started with creating training, testing, and validation datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Traditional train/test split\n",
    "> In the first few lessons, we called data \"seen\" data if it was used for model fitting, while \"unseen\" data described the data we did not train our model on. In model validation, we use holdout samples to replicate this idea. We define a holdout dataset as any data that is not used for training and is only used to assess model performance. The available data is split into two datasets. One used for training, and one that is simply off limits while we are training our models, called a test (or holdout) dataset. This step is vital to model validation and is the number one step you can take to ensure your model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dataset definitions and ratios\n",
    "> We use the holdout sample as a testing dataset so that we can have an unbiased estimate for our model's performance after we are completely done training. Generally, a good rule of thumb is using an 80:20 split. This equates to setting aside twenty percent of the data for the test set and using the rest for training. You might choose to use more training data when the overall data is limited, or less training data if the modeling method is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The X and y datasets\n",
    "> Before we use scikit-learn's holdout creation function train_test_split(), we will use the tic_tac_toe dataset and create an X dataset with the predictive data, and a y dataset with just the responses. The first nine columns of tic_tac_toe can be used for training, while the 10th column contains the response values. As a quick aside, classification models for categorical values, such as those found in the tic_tac_toe dataset, require dummy variables. If you are unfamiliar with dummy variables, check out DataCamp's other courses that go into more detail here.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creating holdout samples\n",
    "> The train_test_split() function is straightforward. We split both the X and the y datasets, into both a train and a test dataset. This function has a few parameters that we will use. test_size takes either a float or an integer and specifies how big the test set should be. If test_size is blank, you can instead use train_size to set the size of the training set. And finally, random_state allows for setting the model seed and helps maintain reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Dataset for preliminary testing?\n",
    "> We know that the test set is off limits until we are completely done training, but what do we do when testing model parameters? For example, if we run a random forest model with 100 trees and one with 1000 trees, which dataset do we use to test these results?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Holdout samples for parameter tuning\n",
    "> When testing parameters, tuning hyper-parameters, or anytime we are frequently evaluating model performance we need to create a second holdout sample, called the validation dataset. For this dataset, the available data is the original training dataset, which is then split in the same manner used to split the original complete dataset. We use the validation sample to assess our model's performance when using different parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Train, validation, test continued\n",
    "> To create both holdout samples, the testing, and the validation datasets, we use scikit-learn's train_test_split() function twice. The first call will create training and testing datasets like normal. The second call we split this so-called temporary training dataset into the final training and validation datasets. In this example, we first used an 80/20 split to create the test set. With the 80% training dataset, we used a 75/25 split to create a validation dataset. Leaving us with 60% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. It's holdout time\n",
    "> Let's practice making holdout sets to use in our models."

    "1. Accuracy metrics: regression models\n",
    "> Now that we have learned about holdout samples let's discuss accuracy metrics used when validating models — starting with regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression models\n",
    "> Remember, regression models are built for continuous variables. This could be predicting the number of points a player will score tomorrow, or the number of puppies a dog is about to have!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mean absolute error (MAE)\n",
    "> To assess the performance of a regression model, we can use the mean absolute error. It is the simplest and most intuitive error metric and is the average absolute difference between the predictions (y_i) and the actual values (y_i hat). If your dog had six puppies, but you had predicted only four, the absolute difference would be two. This metric treats all points equally and is not sensitive to outliers. When dealing with applications where we don't want large errors to have a major impact, the mean absolute error can be used. An example could be predicting your car's monthly gas bill, when an outlier may have been caused by a one-time road trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Mean squared error (MSE)\n",
    "> Next is the mean squared error (MSE). It is the most widely used regression error metric for regression models. It is calculated similarly to the mean absolute error, but this time we square the difference term. The MSE allows larger errors to have a larger impact on the model. Using the previous car example, if you knew once a year you might go on a road trip, you might expect to occasionally have a large error and would want your model to pick up on these trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. MAE vs. MSE\n",
    "> Picking between the MAE and the MSE comes down to the application. These results are in different units though and should not be directly compared!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Mean absolute error\n",
    "> To practice these metrics, let's use the ultimate Halloween candy data dataset. Here we are predicting the win-percentage of candies in head-to-head match-ups with other candies. Let's assume we have already fit a random forest model and calculated predictions for the test dataset. For the mean absolute error, we can calculate this two ways. A manual calculation, which takes the sum of the absolute differences and divides by the total number of observations, or we can use scikit-learn's mean_absolute_error() function. We provide an array of the actual values, followed by an array of the predictions. Both methods produce a single value of 9-point-99 as the output. We are covering the manual calculations for these functions to understand the results of these error metrics. Notice that we are looking at the test data accuracy. This error means that we are about 10 percentage-points off on average when predicting the win-percentage. As win-percentages range from 0 to 1, this is fairly good.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Mean squared error\n",
    "> For the mean squared error, we can calculate this manually or with the mean_squared_error() function. Both methods produce a value of 141-point-4. In this example, the mean squared error is a more appropriate accuracy metric, as we want outliers to have more of an impact on the model's performance. For example, if one chocolate bar really underperforms, there may be attributes of that chocolate bar that truly matter other than it being chocolate.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Accuracy for a subset of data\n",
    "> Sometimes we want to know a model's accuracy for a specific subset, such as how this model performs on only chocolate candies. If column 1 in our test set has 1's for candies containing chocolate, and 0; otherwise, we filter the test array based on these values and run the accuracy metrics. Since the chocolate candies had errors of less than 9 and the non-chocolate candies had errors of 11, the model performed better on chocolate candy.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Let's practice\n",
    "> Let's work through a couple of examples on regression accuracy metrics."

    "> Welcome back! We already understand classification models; now let's look at their accuracy metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classification metrics\n",
    "> Classification accuracy metrics are quite a bit different than regression ones. Remember, with classification models; we are predicting what category an observation falls into. There are a lot of accuracy metrics available. There is precision, recall, accuracy, specificity, F1-Score, alternate forms of the F1-score, and several others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Classification metrics\n",
    "> We will focus on precision, recall, and accuracy. As each of these are easy to understand and have very practical applications. One way to calculate these metrics is to use the values from the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Confusion matrix\n",
    "> When making predictions, especially if there is a binary outcome, this matrix is one of the first outputs you should review. When we have a binary outcome, the confusion matrix is a 2x2 matrix that shows how your predictions faired across the two outcomes. For example, for predictions of 0 that were actually 0 (or true negatives), we look at the 0, 0 square of the matrix. All of the accuracy metrics from the previous slide can be calculated using the values from this matrix, and it is a great way to visualize the initial results of your classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create confusion matrix with scikit-learn\n",
    "> We can create a confusion matrix using scikit-learn's function confusion_matrix(). When dealing with binary data, this will print out a 2x2 array which represents the confusion matrix. In this matrix, the row index represents the true category, and the column index represents the predicted category. Therefore, the 1, 0 entry of the array represents the number of true 1s that were predicted to be 0, or 8 in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Accuracy\n",
    "> Accuracy is the easiest metric to understand and represents the overall ability of your model to correctly predict the correct classification. Using the confusion matrix, we add the values that were predicted 0 and actually are 0 (which are called true negatives), to the values predicted to be 1 that are 1 (called true positives), and then divide by the total number of observations. In this case, our accuracy was 85%. In this example, you can associate a true positive as predicted 1's that are also actually 1's. However, if your categories were win or loss, you might associate a true positive as the number of predicted wins that were actually wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Precision\n",
    "> Next is precision or the number of true positives out of all predicted positive values. We correctly predicted 62 true values but also predicted 7 false positives. Therefore, the precision is 62 divided by 69. Precision is used when we don't want to overpredict positive values. If it cost $2,000 to fly-in potential new employee's, a company may only have on-campus interviews with individuals that they really believe are going to join their company. In the example data, almost 9 out of 10 predicted 1's would have joined the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Recall\n",
    "> The recall metric is about finding all positive values. Here we correctly predicted 62 true positives and had 8 false negatives. Our recall is 62 out of 70. Recall is used when we can't afford to miss any positive values. For example, even if a patient has a small chance of having cancer, we may want to give them additional tests. The cost of missing a patient who has cancer is far greater than the cost of additional screenings for that patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "> Accuracy, precision, and recall are called similarly. Use the desired accuracy metric function and provide the true and predicted values. A single value will be produced as a result. In this example, we got the same values that we calculated using the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Practice time\n",
    "> Let's work through a couple of examples using these accuracy metrics."

    "1. The bias-variance tradeoff\n",
    "> Hello again. Let's try to identify when we have a good fitting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance\n",
    "> One way to do this is to consider bias and variance. Variance occurs when a model pays too close attention to the training data and fails to generalize to the testing data. These models perform well on only the training data, but not the testing data, and are considered to be overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overfitting models (high variance)\n",
    "> Overfitting occurs when our model starts to attach meaning to the noise in the training data. In this graphic, you can see the natural quadratic shape of the orange dots. However, our blue prediction line is hugging the data and would likely not extend well to new orange dots. Overfitting is easy to identify though, as the training error will be a lot lower than the testing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bias\n",
    "> The second term, Bias, occurs when the model fails to find the relationships between the data and the response value. Bias leads to high errors on both the training and testing datasets and is associated with an underfit model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Underfitting models (high bias)\n",
    "> Underfitting occurs when the model could not find the underlying patterns available in the data. This might happen if we don't have enough trees or the trees aren't deep enough. In this example, we have the average of the actual values acting as our prediction. Underfitting is more difficult to identify because the training and testing errors will both be high, and it's difficult to know if we got the most out of the data, or if we can improve the testing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Optimal performance\n",
    "> When our model is getting the most out of the training data, while still performing on the testing data, we have optimal performance. Notice how the blue line is matching the natural quadratic shape of the data and that it is not touching every orange dot. The blue line is a well fit prediction line for future data. So how do we tell if we have a good fit, or if we are just underfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Parameters causing over/under fitting\n",
    "> For random forest models, some parameters that affect performance are max depth and max features. One way to check for a poorly fit model is to try additional parameter sets and check both the training and testing error metrics. Notice that the overall training accuracy is a bit higher than the testing accuracy. We might have some past experience with this type of data that suggests we can expect a much higher accuracy and we conclude that we are probably underfitting. As you run more random forest models, you will get a better sense of which parameters you should tweak. But in this case, a max depth of 4 is probably not deep enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Parameters continued\n",
    "> This time around, we may have made the max depth too large and are overfitting. Achieving 100% accuracy on the training dataset while only getting 83% on testing is a clear sign that we are overfitting. We always compare how well the model performed on the data it has seen to the data it has not seen.\n",

    "The candy dataset is prime for overfitting. With only 85 observations, if you use 20% for the testing dataset, you are losing a lot of vital data that could be used for modeling. Imagine the scenario where most of the chocolate candies ended up in the training data and very few in the holdout sample. Our model might only see that chocolate is a vital factor, but fail to find that other attributes are also important. In this exercise, you'll explore how using too many features (columns) in a random forest model can lead to overfitting.\n",
